Before use, replace the URL link with your server's domain name. 
Also, under the same folder: chmod +x *.sh.

2. check the return message contains "successfully logged in", and make sure cookies.txt resides in the same directory with ./upload_*.sh
3. to upload a file in private/public: ./upload_*.sh [file_path]
